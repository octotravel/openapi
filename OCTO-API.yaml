      "description": "Reserving availability when making a booking. The steps to make a reservation are:\n\n1. **Check Availability**: Check the availability on the [/availability](docs/octo/branches/main/5b08f5f75e75d-availability-check) endpoint to retrieve an `availabilityId`\n2. **Booking Reservation** (this step): Create a booking that reserves the availability while you collect payment and contact information from the customer. The booking will remain with status `ON_HOLD` until the booking is confirmed or the reservation hold expires.\n\nThe availability for the booking is held for the amount of time equal to the`expirationMinutes` parameter (if provided), up to an internal limit set by either the supplier or the OCTo provider. The `utc_expires_at` parameter in the response object will indicate when a reservtion will expire. A reservation can be extended by calling the [/bookings/{uuid}/extend](docs/octo/branches/main/2c7924ab9128f-extend-reservation) endpoint.\n\nA reserved booking can be confirmed after the customer finalizes their choice on the [/bookings/{uuid}/confirm](docs/octo/branches/main/614d1613b2d70-booking-confirmation) endpoint provided the reservation had not expired.\n"
